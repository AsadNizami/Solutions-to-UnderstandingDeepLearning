## Understanding Deep Learning - Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the book "Understanding Deep Learning" by Simon J.D. Prince.

### Progress
I have completed nearly all solutions (notebook + [textbook](https://github.com/AsadNizami/Solutions-to-UnderstandingDeepLearning/blob/main/Solutions_to_UDL.pdf)) for:
